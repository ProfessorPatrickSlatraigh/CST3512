Creating visualization with techniques that account for human perception can highlight important insights.

To better explore such complex data you can apply the results of the considerable research available on human perceptions for data visualization.    \n",

Primarily, we will work with plot aesthetics used to highlight relationships for complex datasets. By plot aesthetics we mean properties of a visualization which highlight aspects of the data relationships.  \n",

Now we will investigate the use of multiple plot axes to highlight relationships in complex datasets. The key idea is that often it is better to have a series of simpler plots showing different projections or subsets of a dataset than a single complex and hard to perceive chart. Complex charts with many colors, markers, line times, etc. displaying a large number of data values can be confusing at best and imperceptible at worse.   \n",
