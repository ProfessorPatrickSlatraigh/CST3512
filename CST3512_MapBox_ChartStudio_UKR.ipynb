For mapping applications that require precision and finer control, Google Map is the choice, but it is not convenient and free for all purposes.

However, plotly doesn't necessarily need an API token from Mapbox as it has a support mapping without an API token as well, but that does not allow for the use of Mapbox mapping tiles. Also, API-token-free mapping calls in plotly have poor map rendering. However, API token generation in Mapbox is so easy that there is no reason not to use it. Here is an example."
